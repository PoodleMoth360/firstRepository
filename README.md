### Here is a portfolio of my best p5.jS projects from MAGD150!

_assignment 1_: my first project of a black and white cityscape. I've come a long way!

_assignment 2_: more of me messing around with cool shapes. I made some emoji balloons, and they're pretty cute!

_assignment 6_: an experiment with arrays. I used them to make an animated cursor of Poumba the friendly pumpkin, and a haunted house backdrop for him. This one is my personal favorite.

_assignment 7_: an experiment with making my own functions. I drew a sword, and called it as a function to replicate it into a blade wheel. I'd fix some spacing issues if I had more time, because one of them is _slightly_ off and makes me tick.
